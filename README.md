# TA session of Applied Econometrics (AECN 396/AECN896-002)

This is the repository for the TA session for AECN896-002. I upload the presentation slides used in the TA sessions here. Also, I upload some additional materials for your learning. I'm going to update these contents as we progress through the class. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas about the contents of this repository.

## For your learning

### Coure Overview ([Here](https://shunkei3.github.io/Applied_Econometrics_TA/Appendix/Overview.html))
+ Sometimes, it is good to look at the big picture, review what we have learned so far. I listed main topics of each lecture. You can use this to check your understanding of the materials. 

### A List of R Functions for Econometric Analysis ([Here](https://shunkei3.github.io/Applied_Econometrics_TA/Appendix/ls_CodesForRegression.html))
+ We will see various R functions for practical econometric analysis through this course. I thought it would be helpful to put all those R functions in the same file so you don't need to search for these functions and their usages by yourself every time. 


### R Exercise Problems
+ The best way to learn R is to expose yourself to R more often and learn how to code by hand. I prepared some R exercise problems along with the R lab sessions. Let's use your knowledge of R programming from the lab session by working on these problems. 
+ Data Wrangling with the `tidyverse` package ([Here](https://shunkei3.github.io/Applied_Econometrics_TA/R-Exercise/1-DataWrangling.html))
+ Data Visualization
